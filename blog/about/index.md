# About

Most posts in my blog are about Programming, Computer Science and Math. I’m terrible for names, but NP-Incompletness sounded reasonable. It’s a word play with the concept of NP-Completeness and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.

Why blogging? Because I like to write down notes from things I’ve studied to help organizing my thoughts and also to detect gaps in understanding. It may be also useful for future reference.

## Interests

I've been interested in many topics over time, some come and go, others go and come. Here's a list of topics I was interested at some point, roughly in reverse chronological order:

* Automated reasoning
* Signal Processing
* Natural Language Processing
* Quantum Computing
* Computational Biology
* Distributed Systems
* Functional Programming
* Information Visualization
* Frontend Web Development
* Combinatorial Optimization
* Computational Geometry
* Programming Puzzles / Competitions

If you're interested in any of these and want to collaborate somehow, please reach out!
