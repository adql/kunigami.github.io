This is a meta-post to review what happened in 2011.

## First Semester

The first semester was very exhausting, but also productive.

**Papers.** Writing papers is one of the things that motivates me the most in academia. Since the end of 2010 we were writing a paper that ended up being accepted at the CGA (*Computational Geometry Applications*) conference.

Earlier this year, our extended abstract was accepted at the CTW (*Cologne-Twente Workshop*). When I started writing my dissertation, we saw the possibility of writing yet another article, which was accepted by Sibigrapi.

**Sibgrapi.** I went to present our accepted paper at Sibgrapi in Macei√≥. It was my first congress and the first time I presented in English and to a large audience. I wrote a [post](https://kuniga.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/sibgrapi-2011/) about the event.

**Master's Defense.** After approximately 2 years of hard work, I concluded my master's project with the defense of my thesis.

**Google Summer of Code.** During the first semester, I was accepted to *Google Summer of Code* to work on a Computer Graphics project (integrate a shader). I had to juggle this project with writing my dissertation and writing the paper for Sibgrapi!

Fortunately, in the end everything worked out. I wrote several posts about this project.

**Google Code Jam.** I didn't qualify for the regionals, but I ended up in the top 1000 and winning a shirt :)

**New job!** Thanks to Carlos' referral, I'm now working at an optimization company, CFlex. So far I'm learning a lot about Java software development, as well as reading paper and implementing solutions to scheduling problems.

## Second Semester

For the remainder of the second semester, things were much calmer.

**Codefest.** I participated in a competition where we were supposed to tackle an optimization problem, having two weeks to implement a solution. In the end we didn't take the prize due to a silly bug, as I described [here](https://kuniga.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/codefest-2011/).

**Haskell.** I decided to start learning Haskell in order to improve my programming skills. I've been surprised by the elegance of some code snippets and the syntax of the language.

## Blog

The blog is about to complete 3 years. I have managed to keep my resolution to post once a week.

<!-- The most accessed posts this year were: Branch and Cut Algorithm, Point inside polygon and Dijkstra and the longest path. -->

<!-- The most used terms in search engines were: "soccer", "aisec" and "ray tracing". A curious search term is "get the cgal symmetric polygon" which has appeared 89 times and I have no idea what that is! -->

The blog had an average of 42 visits per day, with a total of 16k since its inception. The day with the most visits was November 30th with 104 visitors.

## Resolutions for 2012

For 2012, I've already enrolled in two Stanford online courses: [Probabilist Graphical Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models) and [Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing).

I would like to learn more about data mining aimed at supporting decision making and also about stochastic optimization/programming, which considers factors of uncertainty, very present in the problems we tackle in the industry.

Given that, I think the probabilistic graphical modeling course will help bolster my probability base knowledge (which is pretty weak). The natural language processing course I took more out of curiosity and I still haven't decided if I'm actually going to do it.

## Notes
