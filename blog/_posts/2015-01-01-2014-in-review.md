I'd like to share a little of what happened during 2014. I've been living in the US for two years now. Time flies!

This year I learned about two programming languages, R and Emacs Lisp. I'm still focusing on learning Haskell and functional programming as a long term goal. I still didn't finish the Real World Haskell book.

I've completed three Coursera classes: Machine Learning, Mining Massive Data Sets and R Programming. Mining Massive Data Sets was by far the hardest and the most interesting. I learned a lot of new algorithms and paradigms. I blogged about one of those, the [Page Rank Algorithm]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/11/24/the-pagerank-algorithm.html), but I also plan to study others like bloom filters in more depth. I also wrote about [R Programming]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/12/30/introduction-to-the-r-language-for-programmers.html) and [Machine Learning]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/06/04/supervised-machine-learning.html) classes.

I've started studying distributed programming, with the [Paxos algorithm]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/04/14/the-paxos-protocol.html).

I finished reading [GÃ¶del, Escher and Bach](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/) from Douglas Hofstadter, which I thought was fantastic. It got me interested in Biology and Music Theory and I hope one day start studying them.

### Blog

The most popular post of 2014 is still [Skip Lists in Python]({{site.url}}/blog/2012/09/25/skip-lists-in-python.html) from 2012 (1.5k views). From this year, it was [An Introduction to the Parsec library]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/01/21/an-introduction-to-the-parsec-library.html) (900 views).

I tried to keep the frequency of monthly posts, but I missed March and September. The blog has 2 years and 24 posts.

### Ideas for 2015

Books: I want to read [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670), which is supposed to be a light read. For more technical books, I want to finish the [Real World Haskell](http://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Haskell-Bryan-OSullivan/dp/0596514980) book and start [Purely Functional Data Structures](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/). If time allows it, I will try reading a book about distributed programming.

I will still try to keep posting once a month.

Things I wish to do is writing more code - I want to start more projects and contribute to open source - and also read more code: I often read books and blog posts, but rarely read open source code. My idea is to also post about  code that I read.
