In Chapter 10 of [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/code-case-study-parsing-a-binary-data-format.html), the authors explain how to write a parser for a PGM file.

They start with a very direct and verbose solution. Along the chapter they perform abstractions that allows code reuse. Then, they end up with a much concise and legible solution.

Part of the abstraction makes use of functors, and it's about them that we'll talk briefly in this post. Since functors also exists in C++, we'll talk about them too, even though they represent different concepts in each of these languages.

### Functors in Haskell

You're probably acquainted with maps. Nevertheless, let's see an example in Haskell:

`map (+1) [1,2,3]`

A map receives a function that transform an element of type `a` in a element in `a` type `b` and a list of elements of type `a`. We can see this by checking the its type on ghci:

{% highlight text %}

>:t map
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

{% endhighlight %}

What if we want to apply a function to the elements of other structures beside lists?

Let's start with the `Maybe` datatype already defined on Prelude:

{% highlight text %}

data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

{% endhighlight %}

In this case, the example `map (+1) (Just 1)` will not work. So, let's write a function to apply the function only to the "internal" type of a `Maybe`:

{% highlight text %}

maybeMap:: (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
maybeMap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
maybeMap _ Nothing  = Nothing

{% endhighlight %}

A classical example is performing a map over the elements a tree. Let's define a datatype `Tree` representing a binary tree:

{% highlight text %}

data Tree a =   Node (Tree a) (Tree a) 
              | Leaf a 
                deriving (Show)

{% endhighlight %}

To apply a function to its internal elements we can do:

{% highlight text %}

treeMap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
treeMap f (Leaf a)   = Leaf (f a)
treeMap f (Node l r) = Node (treeMap f l) (treeMap f r)

{% endhighlight %}

We can test it by doing:

{% highlight text %}

> let t = Node (Leaf 1) (Node (Leaf 2) (Leaf 3))
> treeMap (+1) t
Node (Leaf 2) (Node (Leaf 3) (Leaf 4))

{% endhighlight %}

The Prelude allow us to implement a common interface using the typeclass `Functor`:

{% highlight text %}

class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

{% endhighlight %}

Thus, we can specify an implementation for `Maybe`:

{% highlight text %}

instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap = maybeMap

{% endhighlight %}

... for our `Tree` datatype:

{% highlight text %}

instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap = treeMap

{% endhighlight %}

... and for lists:

{% highlight text %}

instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map

{% endhighlight %}

We can then use now `fmap` to perform mapping on lists, `Maybe` or `Tree`:

{% highlight text %}

fmap (+1) [1, 2, 3] // [2, 3, 4]
fmap (+1) (Just 10) // Just 11
fmap (+1) (Leaf 0) // (Leaf 1) 

{% endhighlight %}

Note that we can also apply this function recursively to perform mappings into inner types, for example:

{% highlight text %}

fmap (fmap (+1)) [[1,2], [3]] // [[2,3], [4]]
fmap (fmap (*2)) [Just 4] // [Just 8]

{% endhighlight %}

The idea of functors is to perform mappings over the internal elements of datatype, but without affecting its structure.

For instance, a function that receives a `(Just 1)` and returns `Nothing`, is not preserving the `Maybe` structure. The same can be said about any function that changes the topology of a `Tree`.

So, functors are expected to satisfy two properties: identity and composability.

The  property says that `(fmap id)` is equivalent to `id`. Since we're not changing the internal elements neither the structure of a datatype, we are not changing the datatype at all.

The  means that `(fmap f) . (fmap g)` is equivalent to `fmap (f . g)`

For further details, this subject is pretty well explained in [2] and [3].

### Functors in C++

In C++ we also have the concept of functors, but it has a different meaning. Here a functor is an object that acts as a function.

Basically, C++ functors are classes that define the `operator()`. Here's an example:

{% highlight cpp %}

struct Functor {
    void operator() (){
        cout << "Functor\n";
    }
};
...
Functor f;
f();

{% endhighlight %}

What's the difference between overloading the `operator()` and using any other method instead? For instance, one could define a method `apply()` and use it like this:

{% highlight cpp %}

struct Functor {
    void apply(){
        cout << "Functor\n";
    }
};
...
Functor f;
f.apply();

{% endhighlight %}

The answer to the question is that, besides the syntax sugar (i.e. calling `f()` instead of `f.apply()`), overloading the `operator()` allows functors and function pointers to be used alike with templates. Consider the following example,

{% highlight cpp %}

struct Functor {
    void operator() (){
        cout << "Functor\n";
    }
};
void f(){
    cout << "Function\n";
}

template<typename F>
void callFunction(F func){
    func();
}

int main(){
    callFunction(f); // Function
    callFunction(Functor()); // Functor
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Here, both `f()` and an instance of `Functor` can be passed as parameter to `callFunction()`. This is pretty much like the STL `sort` function.

The advantage of functors over regular functions is that they can have internal state, like the example below.

{% highlight cpp %}

struct Functor {
    int x;

    Functor(int _x){
        x = _x;
    }    
    int operator() (int y){
        return x + y;
    }
};

int main (){    
    Functor addTwo(2);    
    cout << addTwo(13) << endl;
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Sure, one could achieve the same behavior with functions using global variables, but with functors we get more encapsulation.
