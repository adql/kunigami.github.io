David Elieser Deutsch is a British scientist at the University of Oxford, being a pioneer of the field of quantum computation by formulating a description for a quantum Turing machine.

Richard Jozsa is an Australian mathematician at the University of Cambridge and is a co-inventor of quantum teleportation.

Together they proposed the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm which, although not useful in practice, it provides an example where a quantum algorithm can outperform a classic one.

In this post we'll describe the algorithm and the basic theory of quantum computation behind it.

## Quantum Mechanics Abstracted

In this post we'll work with abstractions on top of Quantum mechanics concepts, namely qubits and quantum gates. A lot of properties we'll leverage such as superposition and teleportation arise from the theory of Quantum mechanics but we'll not delve into their explanation, but rather take them as facts to keep things simpler.

We'll also try to avoid making any real-world interpretation of the theoretical results, since it's known to be counter-intutive, sometimes paradoxical and overall not agreed upon.
