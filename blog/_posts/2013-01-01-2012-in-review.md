This is a meta-post to review what happened in 2012. This was actually written in 2021 and so is just a scattered set of recollections.

## Blog

I decided to start writing in English. One of my very first posts in English, [Skip Lists in Python]({{site.url}}/blog/2012/09/25/skip-lists-in-python.html) was mentioned on Reddit (r/python) and became very popular. I recall the day it got popular, I got 10k visits in a day (whereas the usual is a dozen).

With the craziness of moving abroad and starting a new job, *Skip Lists in Python* was also the last post I wrote in 2021, in September, thus breaking the streak of posting weekly.

## Personal

I've moved to the US and started working for Facebook. Paulo, a long time friend of programming contests, also started with me, so we became roommates.

I've visited the Yosemite National Park.
