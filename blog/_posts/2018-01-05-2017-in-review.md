This is a meta-post to review what happened in 2017.

I focused on finishing reading *Purely Functional Data Structures*, by Chris Okasaki, which was one of my goals from last year, so it's no surprise that more than half of my posts were notes on it. In the process, I learned more about OCaml's features. Speaking of OCaml, I used it to answer a [question on subsequences]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/05/22/largest-sets-of-subsequences-in-ocaml.html).

I also completed a [course on Scala]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/03/01/notes-on-coursera's-functional-programming-principles-in-scala.html), which was another of my 2017's resolutions.

I finally took some time to play with my raspberry Pi, to develop a [web server]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/01/16/domestic-server-using-raspberry-pi.html) and a [simple monitoring system]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/07/29/monitoring-system-using-raspberry-pi.html).

Other things included learning more about [how JavaScript works]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/06/01/notes-on-javascript-interpreters.html), about [Google's Spanner database]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/04/27/paper-reading---spanner:-google's-globally-distributed-database.html). I've also attended a conference, the [OpenVis Conf]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/05/01/openvis-conf-2017.html).

### Personal

The end of the year is a good time to look back and remember all the things Iâ€™ve done besides work and the technical blog.

### Trips

As in 2016, 2017 was very busy with trips.

I visited quite a few cities in the Eastern US this year. This included Washington DC, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago. I must say they have better museums than the West coast. My favorite ones were the Smithsonian and the Boston MFA.

I love National Parks and was glad to be able to visit a few of them. This included trips to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, here in California. In Seattle, I made a quick trip to the Olympic National Park. And more recently, Carlsbad Caverns and Big Bend (New Mexico and Texas).

For a long time I wished to visit Japan and I was finally able to make it. I spent 2 weeks there, exploring the main cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Komatsu, Hiroshima, Himeji.

### Books

I read a lot of fiction this year.

*War and Peace* took me a long time to get through, but it was a very rewarding read. It's a mix between history, philosophy and fiction, set during the 1812 invasion or Russia by Napoleon. *Slaughterhouse-Five* is also about war, the WWII, with a dark humor take.

*If on a winter's night a traveler* by Italo Calvino is sort of a meta-book, full of self-references. Pretty interesting read.

*Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World*, *Strange Weather in Tokyo* and *Snow Country* all have their background in Japan. I enjoyed the idea of reading books related to a country before visiting it.

I'm usually not into science-fiction but I enjoyed reading *Red Mars*.

For non-fiction, *Survival of the Sickest* was my favorite science book of the year. *Homo Deus* was also very interesting. It's from the same author of *Homo Sapiens*, Yuval Harari. Even though it's about the future of humanity, I liked his discussions of the present better - especially about humanism.

### The Blog in 2017

Like last year, the most popular post was the [Introduction to the Parsec Library]({{site.url}}/blog/2014/01/21/an-introduction-to-the-parsec-library.html), with 1.6k visits. From this year, the notes on [Google's Spanner database]({{site.url}}/blog/2017/04/27/paper-reading---spanner:-google's-globally-distributed-database.html) paper got 250 views. Overall it had 9.5k visitors.

I kept the resolution to post at least once a month. The blog completed 5 years with 66 posts.

### Resolutions for 2018

For this year, I plan to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). I haven't decided which technical book to read yet. I also want to learn mobile development and read more papers.
